# expungement
expungement program for Louisiana
I wrote this as my first legal analysis automation try, to practice and sort how to write a useful program, and to make it personally useful for my colleagues to simplify the learning curve. The logic flow is mostly pulled off the Justice and Accountability app, all the scripting is fresh. 

I used javascript. It is only tested and set to work on desktop Windows and Linux environment. It works on small screens but it needs the formatting fixed.

* A clear explanation of what is filed when, where, and how, the process 
* For all the spots it ends with attorney review needed you should try to break it all the way down
* explanatory section about IFPs, or link to an explantion; you have a current IFP form link already in Forms
* All the recent statutes are included, the marijuana and automation statutes.
* Make the formatting look good on small screens.
