# expungement
expungement program for Louisiana
I wrote this as my first legal analysis automation try, to practice and sort how to write a useful program, and to make it personally useful for my colleagues to simplify the learning curve. The logic flow is mostly pulled off the Justice and Accountability app, all the scripting is fresh. 

I used javascript. It is only tested and set to work on desktop Windows and Linux environment. It works on small screens

* A clear explanation of what is filed when, where, and how, the process would make it a real resource for attorneys.
* For all the spots it ends with attorney review needed you could try to break it all the way down to the elements the attorneys use for those.
* explanatory section about IFPs, or link to an explantion; you have a current IFP form link already in Forms
* All the recent statutes are included as of 12-17-23
* The 12/17/23 fixed the small screen formatting.
