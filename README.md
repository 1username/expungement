# expungement
expungement program for Louisiana
I wrote this as my first legal analysis automation stab, to practice and sort how to write a useful program, and to make it personally useful for my colleagues to simplify the learning curve. The logic flow is mostly pulled off the Justice and Accountability app, all the scripting is fresh. I'm still updating this to get the logic all updated and correct with recent statutory updates , and to increase the level of detail, analysis, links for verification, and inclusion of language for convenience when drafting.

I used javascript. It is only tested and set to work on desktop Windows and Linux environment. I haven't sorted it for small screens or for Iphone/Mac yet. Only set up click events, right now. 

* The 7-8-23 version has 893 and 894 info added to question responses, and drop down 893/894 at top.
* A clear explanation of what is filed when, where, and how, the process 
* For all the spots it ends with attorney review needed you should try to break it all the way down
* There's also that marijuana bill that hasn't been signed yet, and the automation one that hasn't been signed yet, but I'd only put the links to the bills in there somewhere, if they pass set a timer with an alert when they go into effect - needs to be done
* explanatory section about IFPs, or link to an explantion; you have a current IFP form link already in Forms
