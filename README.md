# expungement
expungement program for Louisiana
I wrote this as my first legal analysis automation stab, to practice and sort how to write a useful program, and to make it personally useful for my colleagues to simplify the learning curve. The logic flow is mostly pulled off the Justice and Accountability app, all the scripting is fresh. I'm still updating this to get the logic all updated and correct with recent statutory updates , and to increase the level of detail, analysis, links for verification, and inclusion of language for convenience when drafting.

I used javascript. It is only tested and set to work on desktop Windows and Linux environment. I haven't sorted it for small screens or for Iphone/Mac yet. Only set up click events, right now. 

I still need to put in more for the 893 and 894 analysis.
there's also that marijauana bill that hasn't been signed yet, and the automation one that hasn't been signed yet, but I'd only put the links to the bills in there somewhere
