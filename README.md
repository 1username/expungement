# expungement
expungement program for Louisiana
I wrote this as my first legal analysis automation stab, to practice and sort how to write a useful program, and to make it personally useful for my colleagues to simplify the learning curve. The logic flow is mostly pulled off the Justice and Accountability app, all the scripting is fresh. I'm still updating this to get the logic all updated and correct with recent statutory updates , and to increase the level of detail, analysis, links for verification, and inclusion of language for convenience when drafting.

I used javascript. It is only tested and set to work on desktop Windows and Linux environment. I haven't sorted it for small screens or for Iphone/Mac yet. Only set up click events, right now. 

* I still need to put in more for the 893 and 894 analysis, how that works exactly in practice.
* A clear explanation of what is filed when, the process 
* For all the spots it ends with attorney review needed you should break it all the way down
* There's also that marijuana bill that hasn't been signed yet, and the automation one that hasn't been signed yet, but I'd only put the links to the bills in there somewhere, if they pass set a timer with an alert when they go into effect
* Break down of when somebody qualifies and is eligible for a waiver
* explanatory section about IFPs, or link to one

6/19/23 added in some forms and made a drop down for that, and an unpopulated letters section. Adjusted the response on if they completed pretrial diversion program to address both 976 (A) 1 and 976 (A) 2
