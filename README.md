# expungement
expungement program for Louisiana
I wrote this as my first legal analysis automation stab. The logic flow is pulled off the Justice and Accountability app, all the scripting is fresh. I haven't sorted this to address any copyright issues and therefore it is still private.

I used javascript. It is only tested and set to work on desktop Windows and Linux environment. I haven't sorted it for small screens or for Iphone/Mac yet. Only set up click events, right now.
